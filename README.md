# COVID-19 Data Analysis & Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes COVID-19 cases, recoveries, deaths, and vaccination progress in India using **Excel** for data cleaning and **Power BI** for visualization. The dashboard provides insights into yearly, monthly, and state-wise trends, helping to understand the pandemic's impact across the country.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Excel** – Data cleaning, preprocessing, and formatting
- **Power BI** – Data visualization and dashboard creation
- **DAX** – For calculated columns and measures
- **CSV Files** – Source data for COVID-19 statistics

## 📂 Dataset Details
The project uses three datasets:
1. **case_time_series.csv** – Contains daily confirmed, recovered, and death counts.
2. **raw_data_Indian_states.csv** – State-wise COVID-19 statistics.
3. **vaccination-data.csv** – Vaccination progress data.

## 📈 Dashboard Features
- **Total Confirmed Cases, Recoveries, Deaths, and Vaccinations**
- **Year-wise trend analysis**
- **Top 5 states with maximum cases**
- **Top 10 states by death count**
- **Monthly death trends**
- **Country-wise vaccination comparison**

## 🚀 How I Built It
1. **Data Cleaning in Excel**
   - Removed duplicates
   - Formatted date columns
   - Handled missing values
   - Standardized column names
2. **Data Import into Power BI**
   - Connected cleaned Excel sheets
   - Built relationships between datasets
3. **DAX Measures**
   - Created calculated measures for total cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations
4. **Dashboard Design**
   - Used KPIs, bar charts, pie charts, and line charts for better visual insights
   - Applied color themes for clarity and aesthetics
