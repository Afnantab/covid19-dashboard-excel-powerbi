# COVID-19 Data Analysis & Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes COVID-19 cases, recoveries, deaths, and vaccination progress in India using **Excel** for data cleaning and **Power BI** for visualization. The dashboard provides insights into yearly, monthly, and state-wise trends, helping to understand the pandemic's impact across the country.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Excel** – Data cleaning, preprocessing, and formatting
- **Power BI** – Data visualization and dashboard creation
- **DAX** – For calculated columns and measures
- **CSV Files** – Source data for COVID-19 statistics

## 📂 Dataset Details
The project uses three datasets:
1. **case_time_series-Cleaned.csv** – Contains daily confirmed, recovered, and death counts.
2. **raw_data_Indian_states-Cleaned.csv** – State-wise COVID-19 statistics.
3. **vaccination-data-Cleaned.csv** – Vaccination progress data.

##📌Questions Answered in the Analysis:

1-What is the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases, recoveries, deaths, and vaccinations worldwide?

2-How have the Covid-19 cases and recoveries trended over time (monthly/yearly)?

3-Which top 5 states reported the highest number of confirmed cases?

4-Which states had the highest number of Covid-19 deaths?

5-How did deaths vary month by month during the pandemic?

6-Which countries achieved the highest number of fully vaccinated people?

## 📊 Outcome (Key Metrics)
From the final dashboard:
- **Total Person Fully Vaccinated:** 3,329M  
- **Total Confirmed Recovered:** 7,721M  
- **Total Confirmed Cases:** 8,189M  
- **Total Confirmed Deaths:** 110M

  Additional Insights:
- **Top 5 States by Cases:** Uttar Pradesh (40.05%), West Bengal (34.6%), Telangana (16.32%), Uttarakhand (7.19%), Tripura (3.46%)
- **Top State by Deaths:** Tamil Nadu (8.8M)
- **Peak Monthly Deaths:** May 2021 – 17.5M
